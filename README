Apache-AuthLDAPBind

This is an authentication module for Apache 1.3 (and mod_perl) that
authenticates a user to an LDAP server by binding as that user (with
his supplied password).  If the bind succeeds, the user is
authenticated.  If not, authentication fails.

This is much more secure than the usual method of checking the
password against a hash, since there's no possibility that the hash
will be viewed while in transit (or worse, simply pulled out of the
LDAP database by an attacker), or that the client somehow miscomputes
the hash (since there are a variety of algorithms for password
hashes).  

Since passwords are being sent to the LDAP server over the network,
the server is required to support SSL.  Authentications will fail if
the server doesn't support StartTLS.  Cutting corners is not an option
when dealing with passwords!
